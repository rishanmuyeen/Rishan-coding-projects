This movie recommendation system leverages a dataset from Kaggle to provide personalized movie suggestions. Users can input their favorite movie name, and the system will find the closest match using the difflib library. It retrieves the index of this movie and calculates similarity scores with other movies from a precomputed similarity matrix. The movies are then sorted in descending order of similarity, and the top 30 recommendations are displayed, including their titles and directors. This project combines data processing, similarity algorithms, and interactive user input to enhance the userâ€™s cinematic experience by offering tailored movie recommendations.
